# Lab 1 â€“ Installing Selenium and WebDriver

## Objectives
- Understand the setup process for Selenium and WebDriver in a Python environment.
- Install Selenium and the appropriate WebDriver.
- Create and execute a basic test script to verify installation.

## Tasks
1. Install Selenium with `pip install selenium`.
2. Install the ChromeDriver matching your Chrome browser version.
3. Run a Python script to verify Selenium + WebDriver work correctly.

## Conclusion
Selenium was successfully installed and configured with ChromeDriver.  
We executed a stable script using `Options()` to avoid profile conflicts across environments.
