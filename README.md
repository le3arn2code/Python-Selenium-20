# Python Selenium 20 Labs 🚀

A complete **hands-on journey through Selenium WebDriver with Python** — from installation basics to a real-world **end-to-end mini project**.  

This repository is structured into **20 incremental labs**, each focused on mastering a core concept of browser automation. Whether you’re preparing for interviews, learning automation for QA/DevOps, or just exploring browser scripting, this series provides a **step-by-step, practical guide**.  

---

## 📚 What You’ll Learn
- ✅ Install & configure Selenium WebDriver across environments  
- ✅ Automate browser actions (navigation, clicks, forms, waits)  
- ✅ Work with advanced interactions (alerts, iframes, multiple windows)  
- ✅ Capture screenshots, upload files, and run headless tests  
- ✅ Build an **End-to-End Selenium Project** (Lab 20) simulating a real user workflow
