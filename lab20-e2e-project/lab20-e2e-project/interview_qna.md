# Interview Q&A for Lab 20

**Q1: What is the purpose of an end-to-end test?**  
A1: End-to-end tests validate the entire workflow of an application from start to finish, ensuring all integrated components work together correctly.

**Q2: Why use waits in Selenium?**  
A2: Waits ensure elements are fully loaded before interaction, reducing flakiness in tests.

**Q3: What is the difference between implicit and explicit waits?**  
A3: Implicit waits apply globally and wait for a set duration. Explicit waits target specific elements with conditions until they are met or timeout occurs.

**Q4: Why capture screenshots in automation testing?**  
A4: Screenshots provide visual proof of test results, useful for debugging and reporting.

**Q5: What challenges can arise with Selenium-based end-to-end tests?**  
A5: Flaky tests due to dynamic content, browser-driver mismatches, and handling pop-ups or captchas.
